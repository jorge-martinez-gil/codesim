# Source Code Clone Detection Using Unsupervised Similarity Measures
This repository contains the source code for reproducing the paper Jorge Martinez-Gil: Source Code Clone Detection Using Unsupervised Similarity Measures. (Currently under review)

The dataset has been created by Oscar Karnalim: [https://github.com/oscarkarnalim/sourcecodeplagiarismdataset](https://github.com/oscarkarnalim/sourcecodeplagiarismdataset)

## Overview

This project implements an innovative approaches to detect similarity in Java source code using unsupervised similarity measures. It aims to identify clones in source code efficiently, offering a valuable tool for software maintenance and plagiarism detection.

## How it Works

Each script `java-sim-*-opt.py` processes the Java code snippets from the IR-Plag dataset. There are 21 different methods implemented.
